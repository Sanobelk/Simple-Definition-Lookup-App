# Quick Definition Lookup
Using the free API from [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/), I've created a simple and effective definition lookup app.

## Why?

There are a few things that annoyed me when using dictionary websites.

1. It provides a plethora of information. While synonyms , pronounciation and examples are appreciated, usually all I need is a simple definition. I'm not an English major. I'm a simple man with simple needs.
1. If I lookup another search result, I'm pushed onto another page. I don't like being tossed around.
1. If I want to see the previous search results, I either have to navigate through my browser history manually or hit the back button until I find what I'm looking for. I'm very lazy.

This app solves the three issues above. This is by no means a replacement for any dictionary book or website. Its just meant to make my life (and hopefully yours) easier when searching for definitions and nothing more.

**This was also my first app built with an API. Yay.**

## Built With
This app was built with plain old HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript.

## To Do
* [ ] Add a button that clears the search results
* [ ] Add multi-language functionality
